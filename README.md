# Ad Auction Dashboard
This is a project built by myself and 4 other colleagues for our year 2 COMP2211 assignment.

To run it, make sure to get one of the two data folders required as input for the program from here:

The assignment consisted of us working as a team of 5 and succesfully employing 
AGILE methodologies such as SCRUM to develop a real program for a possible company.

Our task was to use the two folders with data in the form of 34mb and 640mb .csv files 
and project relevant charts to the clients about their ad campaings through a intuitive,
yet elegant UI. Customer feedback was very important so we made sure we had our program
running fast enough on such big files while also displaying meaningful information all 
whilst taking into consideration the feedback from our users.
